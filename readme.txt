== Description ==


This is a plugin that provides a customizable A-Z index of the posts displayed on a particular page, category or product listing.

I have added a new interface to make it easier to use this plugin. All you have to do is open up your page editor and you will see an A-Z index icon (see screenshots).

This plugin works in 3 situations now:
1. An existing page that has some sort of a list on it already (e.g. a testimonials page, or a WooCommerce product listing)
2. An existing category page (e.g. a blog category)
3. A blank page that you want to list something in WordPress on.

= I want to have a page that is a list of artists. Each artists page will have a picture and a description. I also want to have a page that has lyrics. 

What do I need to do to set this up? I can't figure it out. Do I create a page for each artist and then do what to make them show up on a page called artists?

So basically it will be a page called http://xxxxx/artists

On that page will be the A-Z

When you click on the appropriate letter, it shows the artists pictures under that letter.

How do I do this? =

You should put your artists in A-Z Index Posts (left sidebar) and set the featured image for each post.  Try 3 or 4 to start.

Then make a page called Artists (or whatever you want to call it).

Then use the A-Z Index button on the Page editor, click "Display Content" and set the Post Type to azindexcustom.

It should generate something like this:
[azindex content="true" posttype="azindexcustom"]

The first code will display the A-Z for all categories.  The second one will display the actual listings.

In order to get the format you want, you would need to know something about PHP to get the picture appearing etc. 
where you could make a file like listing.php in the templates subdirectory of your theme and refer to that.
You can put it in wp-content/themes/YourTheme/bemo-a-z-index and refer to it in the dialog.
